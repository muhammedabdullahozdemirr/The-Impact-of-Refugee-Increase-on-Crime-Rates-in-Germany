## Project Description

This project investigates the relationship between refugee population growth and crime rates in Germany. Using real-world datasets from Eurostat, UNHCR, and the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), we examine regional and temporal trends to identify possible correlations and causal insights.

Our aim is to determine whether rising refugee numbers have any statistically significant impact on different types of crime, while accounting for confounding factors such as geography and time.

##  Research Questions

- Is there a statistically significant correlation between refugee population changes and crime rates?
- Are regions with higher refugee concentrations experiencing higher crime rates?
- Which types of crimes (e.g., violent, property) are most affected?
- How have both refugee numbers and crime rates changed over the past decade?
